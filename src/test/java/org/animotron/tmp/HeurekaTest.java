	 * If an object or topic has a property in a relation that connects an internal object to an external object 
	 * and they are found identical or the same or equivalent you have comment called heureka
	 * 
	 * Heureka accompanies a match where an object is identical with another object, 
	 * one being external the other one internal in either direction or relationship. 
	 * So either the computer or the user may say that as acknowledgement to such a return. 
	 * The identity may be partial or full, on many or one object, property or relation sorted.
	 * 
	 * But sorting calls for commenting on realtions and expaning the topic of  relation with comments
	 * At this juncture we could turn the codes into subroutins to be called to use tem for repeated procedures 
	 * and to lift them into natural langauge level by giving the code words to sand for the function that the subroutine does.
	 * 
	 * Heureka is the end of a match procedure, resulting in the same as the tautology.
	 * New topic is needed to restart process
	 * Another similar intiial proces sis shock
	 * shock is an object perceived by the sensors that regieter inputon 
	 * the sympathic side of the control system triggerring an iediate rely without doing cognittive analysyssi (semantic parsing) 
	 * but the steps taken in response to such a schosk are rcorder cognitively in the internal system for later use.
	 * 
	 * So on inpt if topic is shock
	 * you halt dialog and change to a different mode/program to rspond activating generators, such as to create movement, 
	 * Just like in the BREZEE example where any sensory input starts the tree feel a breez, hence oscillate or move the branches
	 * 
	 * In terms of cognitie after processing shock means that the object senses has Å‘roven to be too dangeorus to be in contact with or 
	 * approached further.
	 * In an example it may be destructive to the sensor itself by being in a range that is not torerated
	 * In terms of cognitive evaluation is a friend or foe or fight or flee situation where the chat bot cannot 
	 * do anything but chnage subject . stop and intoduce a new topic
